# FPGA-learning-log
Documenting my journey learning FPGA development with the Soan-Papdi board and iCEStudio.

I found the gates. They aren't in the top "Basic" menu like you'd expect; they're actually tucked away in the Collection Manager sidebar on the left. You have to dig into Collection manager > Default Collection > Logic > Sequential to find them.

The "Import Verilog" tool is also pretty buggy. The "OK" button often just freezes when you try to bring in a file. I am still trying to figure this out 

Also, just a heads-up on the npm side of things. I had to use --legacy-peer-deps just to get the install to finish, and you have to run npm start from inside the icestudio folder specifically, or it'll throw errors.
